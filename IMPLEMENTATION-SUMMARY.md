# Implementation Summary for FIXIT Requirements

This document provides a summary of the changes needed to address the requirements in FIXIT-mock-1.md and recommendations for implementation.

## Summary of Required Changes

1. **Fix Light/Dark Theme**
   - The current implementation applies the dark mode class to a div inside the Layout component
   - The fix involves applying the dark mode class to the html element directly using useEffect

2. **Update Model Schema**
   - Add `systemPrompt` field to the ModelCard interface
   - Add `settings` field as a JSON object to the ModelCard interface
   - Update related components to use these new fields

3. **Refactor Model Card Components**
   - Add system prompt input field to the ModelCardEditor
   - Add settings JSON editor to the ModelCardEditor
   - Add MCP server selection to the ModelCardEditor

4. **Enhance MCP Server Management**
   - Add `enabled` field to the MCPServer interface
   - Add toggle functionality to the MCPServerManager service
   - Add UI toggle button for enabling/disabling servers

5. **Update Home Page**
   - Add input component with connection options to model cards or workflows
   - Add output component for displaying results
   - Implement basic processing flow between input and output

## Implementation Approach

I recommend implementing these changes in the following order:

1. **Start with Data Model Changes**
   - Update the interfaces in `app/types/index.ts` first
   - This will provide TypeScript guidance for the rest of the implementation

2. **Fix the Theme Toggle**
   - This is a relatively simple fix in the Layout component
   - It will improve the user experience immediately

3. **Update MCP Server Management**
   - Implement the enable/disable functionality
   - This is a self-contained change that doesn't depend on other components

4. **Update Model Card Components**
   - Add the new fields to the ModelCardEditor
   - Update any related components that display model cards

5. **Redesign the Home Page**
   - Implement the input and output components
   - Add the connection logic between components

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Use React's Context API for global state
- Consider using a state management library like Jotai for more complex state
- Ensure proper state synchronization between components

### Storage
- Use LocalStorage for persisting MCP server settings
- Design the storage service to be adaptable for future database integration
- Implement proper error handling for storage operations

### UI/UX
- Maintain consistent styling across components
- Ensure proper dark mode support throughout the application
- Provide clear feedback for user actions

### Performance
- Optimize rendering of large lists
- Use memoization for expensive computations
- Implement lazy loading for components when appropriate

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components and services
   - Verify correct behavior of the theme toggle
   - Test MCP server enable/disable functionality

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the interaction between components
   - Verify data flow from input to output components
   - Test model card connections

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test the complete user flow
   - Verify that all components work together correctly
   - Test dark mode across the entire application

## Conclusion

The changes outlined in this document will address all the requirements specified in FIXIT-mock-1.md. The implementation plan provides a structured approach to making these changes while maintaining the overall architecture of the application.

By following this plan, you can ensure that the changes are implemented correctly and efficiently, resulting in an improved user experience and more robust application.

To proceed with implementation, switch to Code mode and follow the detailed instructions in FIXIT-PLAN.md.
