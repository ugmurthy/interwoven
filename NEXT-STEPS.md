# Next Steps for Implementation

This document provides a step-by-step guide for implementing the changes outlined in the previous documents.

## Step 1: Switch to Code Mode

Since the Architect mode is limited to editing Markdown files, you'll need to switch to Code mode to implement the actual code changes.

```
Use the switch_mode tool to switch to Code mode
```

## Step 2: Implement the Changes

Follow these steps to implement the changes:

### 1. Update the Types

First, update the type definitions in `app/types/index.ts`:

- Add `systemPrompt` field to the `ModelCard` interface
- Add `settings` field to the `ModelCard` interface
- Add `enabled` field to the `MCPServer` interface

### 2. Fix the Light/Dark Theme

Update the `Layout.tsx` component:

- Remove the dark class from the root div
- Use useEffect to apply dark mode to document.documentElement
- Ensure the theme persists across page refreshes

### 3. Update the MCP Server Manager

Modify the `MCPServerManager.ts` service:

- Add a method to toggle server enabled status
- Update the addServer method to include the enabled field

Then update the `MCPServerManager.tsx` component:

- Add a handler for toggling server enabled status
- Add a toggle button to the server list item

### 4. Update the Model Card Editor

Modify the `ModelCardEditor.tsx` component:

- Add a system prompt field
- Add a settings JSON editor
- Add MCP server selection

### 5. Update the Home Page

Redesign the `Home.tsx` component:

- Add an input component with connection options
- Add an output component for displaying results
- Implement basic processing flow

## Step 3: Test the Changes

After implementing the changes, test the application to ensure everything works as expected:

1. Test the light/dark theme toggle
2. Test adding and editing model cards with the new fields
3. Test enabling and disabling MCP servers
4. Test the input and output components on the home page

## Step 4: Refine and Polish

Once the basic functionality is working, refine and polish the implementation:

- Improve error handling
- Add loading states
- Enhance the UI/UX
- Optimize performance

## Step 5: Document the Changes

Update the documentation to reflect the changes:

- Update the README.md file
- Add comments to the code
- Create user documentation if needed

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll be able to implement all the changes required in FIXIT-mock-1.md. The detailed implementation instructions are provided in FIXIT-PLAN.md, and the architectural overview is available in REVISED-ARCHITECTURE.md.

If you encounter any issues during implementation, refer to the detailed instructions or ask for further assistance.

Good luck with the implementation!
